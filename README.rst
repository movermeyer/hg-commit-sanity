Installation
------------

.. sourcecode ::

    pip install hg-commit-sanity


Configuration
-------------

An example of your .hgrc:

.. code-block:: cfg

  [extensions]
  hg_commit_sanity =

  [hg-commit-sanity]
  .py =
    ^[^#]*import pdb; pdb.set_trace\(\),
    ^print',
  .js =

This will Abort the commit in case it will find import pdb; pdb.set_trace() in *.py files and console. in *.js files
